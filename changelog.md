# Site Changes
- added a meta tag so that the site could detect a mobile device
  and adjust the media query accordingly. Even though before I had
  the media queries set up correctly, when on mobile it did not respond
  correctly. When I added the meta tag for device-width, the media query
  worked as expected
- I also had to edit the margin of the navbar when on mobile.
- I did not add anything else because I am quite happy with the look/style of 
  my website. The additions I added werre more for useability and for the
  site to function correctly

# 3rd Party Script
- I decided to add Google Analytics to my site so that I can monitor traffic
  to my website. 
- I believe that being able to see traffic to your portfolio website is quite 
  important because it shows if your website is engaging and useful. This is 
  similar to how in LinkedIn you are able to see how my profile views you get.
- The way I added Google Analytics to my website is by making a Google Analytics 
  Property and including the url to my website as a data stream. Once I did that
  I was provided a Google Analytics code snippet
- With this code snippet, I was instructed to add it in the <head> of my html file.
  Now I am able to see traffic to my website in the Google Analytics dashboard.
